## ðŸš€ Getting Started

- The Pet Adoption Game is a `console-based application` that simulates the experience of adopting and taking care of a pet. 
- Users can adopt a pet, feed it, play with it, and check its status.
- The game tracks the pet's hunger and happiness levels, and it ends if these levels drop to critical values.

  ## ðŸ¤³ Menue

- **Adopt a Pet:** `Start` the game by adopting a pet.
- **Feed the Pet:** `Increase` the pet's `hunger level` by feeding it.
- **Play with the Pet:** `Increase` the pet's `happiness level` by playing with it.
- **Check Status:** `View` the current `hunger and happiness levels` of the pet.
- **End Game:** `End the game `and `view` the `final status` of the pet.
